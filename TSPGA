2D array is dist table.
fitness (float/ long double) is 1/dist 
prob is specific/total fitness 
a list/pop. of 10 number array (chromossomes/cityRoutes) with inputable size
singleElitism: top ranking harem. --TOO VICIOUS W/ FTNESS PROPORTNT?(isn't trnmnt)
??Fitness proportionate:rndm (0,1)
??Tournament sel:
mutation is must w/ tiny pops

chromossome : genes[9], fitness, prob -WILL RANDOM MUTATE, DO NOT MIX GENE/DIST
population: : chromossomes, size -pop













prob calc: pop fitness sum by individual fiteness stored into ranks and higher places given to smaller fitness
    fitness is higher for desired individuals, do smaller dist = higher acceptation in fitness module
